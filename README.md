# Internal_data_sourcing_EDA

## Introduction
Performed exploratory data analysis on M端sli distribution company. Where the company wanted to understand if their delivery process is healthy. 
Here, I help them to improve the service they offer their customers by developing KPI's and performing EDA with my (other three) team members.

Provided data is of four consistent years from 2017-2020. Data was privately provided by our bootcamp institution. It contains approximately 1 million enteries with geographical locations. 
Overal annual sales fo the company showed gradual increase. That indicates the company is doing all well.
However, to avoid future catastrophies it is always good to keep a watch on current data. Deep diving into data gave us completely different scenario. Hereby, I will
present our results from EDA and the regarding code can be found in the notebook file m端sli_distributors.ipynb.
