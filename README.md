# Agile Project Management and Exploratory Data Analysis for Enhanced Efficiency in Müsli Distribution

## Introduction
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on Müsli Distribution Company: Unveiling Insights for Enhanced Delivery Service

In collaboration with my three team members, I embarked on a mission to assist the Müsli distribution company in improving their customer service by developing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and conducting EDA.

The provided dataset spans four consecutive years, from 2017 to 2020, and consists of approximately 1 million entries with geographical information. It is important to note that the data was shared privately by our bootcamp institution.

Upon initial analysis, we observed a gradual increase in the company's overall annual sales over the years, indicating positive performance. However, to ensure the prevention of future setbacks, it is crucial to continuously monitor the current data and identify potential areas for improvement.

Our deep dive into the data revealed a completely different scenario. In the notebook file "müsli_distributors.ipynb," we have documented our findings from the EDA, along with the corresponding code.

## Questions
As part of our endeavor to assess the health of the Müsli distribution business using the provided data, we sought answers to the following crucial questions:

1. How much time is required to complete each step of the process, including shipping, pick-up, and transport?

2. Are orders being processed within the designated timeframes?

3. Is the pick-up process being executed promptly according to the specified schedule?

4. Are orders being delivered within the expected timeframe?

5. Can we make accurate predictions regarding the overall time required for order processing?

6. Does implementing daily pick-ups yield tangible benefits to the business?

## Results:

## Recommendations:
1. Based on the analysis of the provided data, we have observed that the average order processing time is approximately 10 days. However, to gain further insights into the transit time, it is advisable to consult with the logistics department for more detailed information.

2. Additionally, it is essential to closely monitor and control the order processing time for standard shipping mode to ensure timely delivery and customer satisfaction.

3. Furthermore, our findings indicate that implementing the daily pick-up option will have a significant impact, particularly on the express shipping mode, as compared to the standard mode.

4. Considering these observations, our recommendation is to consider employing additional staff for order processing and treating all orders as express shipping mode. This approach will help streamline the process, reduce processing time, and enhance overall efficiency.

Based on the analysis, we suggest employing more staff for order processing and considering all orders as express shipping mode to improve the efficiency of the Müsli distribution business. Let me know if you need further assistance or have any other questions.
